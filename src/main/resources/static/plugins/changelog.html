<h1>Tiny Textbox.io Release Notes</h1>
<p>
					This document contains information on changes between versions of Textbox.io.
					For more detail and working examples, please consult the developer documentation.
				</p>
    
    
    <h2>Textbox.io 2.4.2.95</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul><li>A custom color dialog has been added to the font, table border and table background color pickers. It can be disabled using the <span style="font-family: monospace">custom</span> property on the <span style="font-family: monospace"><a href="https://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/colors">colors</a></span> configuration option.</li></ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copying and pasting links could convert relative URLs to incorrect absolute URLs on some browsers</li>
<li>Photos with EXIF rotation were not rotated to the correct orientation on insert</li>
<li>Editor height was incorrect in sticky mode</li>
<li>Backwards selections on Firefox ESR 52 caused problems with various dialogs</li>
<li>Autoresize fixes and improvements:
        <ul>
          <li>Editor didn't always shrink when content was removed</li>
          <li>Menus could be cut off by page elements outside of the editor</li>
          <li>Autoresize mode now uses the initial editor height as minimum height</li>
          <li>Toolbar appeared in the wrong position after hiding then bringing back the editor</li>
          <li>Adjusting table border height did not increase editor height</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>Fixes for IE:
        <ul>
          <li>Certain formatting in Word documents resulted in an error on paste</li>
          <li>Attempting to paste from Word multiple times in quick succession could cause a paste failure</li>
          <li>Copying from IE and pasting into Textbox in other browsers could include unnecessary metadata</li>
          <li>Pasting from word documents into an empty document sometimes failed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>Media embed responses from some servers would trigger a console error and not replace the link with the embed content</li>
<li>Content pasted from google docs included unsupported style attributes. Pasting from this source now enforces clean styles.</li>
<li>On Firefox, performing a cut operation within a single text node triggered an error in the console</li>
<li>On Internet Explorer, selecting an image sometimes failed to show resize handles</li>
<li>Menus and dialogs appeared behind bootstrap modal dialogs</li>
<li>The scrollbar in Code view had a higher z-index than the corner button</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Textbox.io 2.4.1.65</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>New "autoresize" feature allows <span style="font-family: monospace">replace()</span> style editors to behave more like <span style="font-family: monospace">inline()</span> editors, adjusting the editor height to the content instead of using scroll bars.
        <ul>
          <li>To turn on this feature, enable the <span style="font-family: monospace"><a href="https://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/autoresize">autoresize</a></span> property of the ui configuration.</li>
          <li>Enabling this feature also turns on the new window docking toolbar behaviour by default (see below).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>Window docking toolbar behaviour from <span style="font-family: monospace">inline()</span> editor style is now available to <span style="font-family: monospace">replace()</span> editor style as well. This greatly improves the editing experience for very tall editors.
        <ul>
          <li>This feature is not enabled by default unless autoresize is enabled. To turn it on, enable the <span style="font-family: monospace"><a href="https://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/toolbar">sticky</a></span> property of the toolbar configuration.</li>
          <li>This behaviour ensures the toolbar is always visible if any part of the editor is visible. The effect applies whens scrolling down a browser window; as the toolbar reaches the top of the window it docks there rather than allowing itself to be hidden. The toolbar will stick until the editor has been completely scrolled off the visible area.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>Applying block styles other than <span style="font-family: monospace">div</span> (e.g. Heading, pre) now removes all formatting within the blocks that change</li>
<li>New <a href="https://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/css"><span style="font-family: monospace">css.showDocumentStyles</span></a> configuration option enables a dynamic style menu based on the content CSS. See the documentation for full details and examples.</li>
<li>New <a href="https://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/colors"><span style="font-family: monospace">ui.colors</span></a> configuration option to customise the list of colors in the color widget. The design of the color widget has changed slightly to accomodate this; all colors now have borders rather than just white.</li>
<li>New <a href="https://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/macros"><span style="font-family: monospace">macros.allowed</span></a> configuration option to adjust the list of default content macros (e.g. markdown) active within the editor. See the documentation for a list of configurable macros.</li>
<li>Several additions and improvements to Word import, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Margins and indentation on multilevel lists and those with custom formatting are converted better</li>
          <li>Ordered lists now retain their numbering in more cases, including when broken up by paragraphs and other elements</li>
          <li>List items with borders import correctly</li>
          <li>Added explicit support for importing Word equations as images</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>BR tags were not added to empty P tags</li>
<li>Using <span style="font-family: monospace">ui.locale</span> editor configuration overrode changes made to the spell checker language via the menu after reloading</li>
<li>Pressing enter to exit a list item did not retain inline formatting</li>
<li>Insert Link dialog did not transition opacity correctly in Safari 11.1</li>
<li>Editor load event was unnecessarily delayed by up to a second</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Textbox.io 2.4.0.47</h2>
<h3>Please Note</h3>
<ul><li>Bookmark targets (all tags with an <span style="font-family: monospace">id</span> attribute) are now shown using a small bookmark icon within the content</li></ul>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>A new Bookmark feature is now available in the default Insert menu
        <ul>
          <li>Insert Bookmark generates bookmark names automatically for ease of use</li>
          <li>When choosing a target bookmark in the Insert Hyperlink dialog, contextual text is shown rather than the bookmark name</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>Top, middle and bottom Cell Vertical Alignment options are now available in the contextual table toolbar</li>
<li>Textbox.io has taken full control over clipboard operations on browsers that support the HTML5 clipboard API. This addresses a number of issues:
        <ul>
          <li>Copying content within or between Textbox.io editors now ignores the <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/paste">paste configuration</a> and always retains styles. This allows clean paste to be enforced without frustrating the user experience by removing styles when pasting editor-created content.</li>
          <li>Copying links no longer translates relative URLs to absolute</li>
          <li>Paste is now more reliable and less likely to result in unwanted cursor movement</li>
          <li>Pasting HTML is now preferred over pasting an image when both are on the clipboard</li>
          <li>Retaining styles while pasting HTML from external sources is no longer subject to browser implementation differences</li>
          <li>Pasting images from macOS Preview into Safari is now supported, by converting the TIFF data to PNG</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>Support for clipboard changes in an upcoming Safari release that breaks pasting from Microsoft Office. We have worked with Apple and made adjustments in this release to minimise the impact of these changes, but there are some things to be aware of:
        <ul>
          <li>Flash is no longer required to paste images. More image types are supported than on any other browser, but some legacy documents (particularly when using Word 2011) will not import images at all.</li>
          <li>The browser has taken control over the style import process
            <ul>
              <li>Cleaning styles behaves exactly as it did before</li>
              <li>Retain styles should <i>appear</i> identical but may have different styling characteristics in the HTML</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Most lists are imported exactly as before, but in some edge cases Safari strips information the editor needs to identify lists. This is tracked as WebKit bug <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182938">182938</a>.</li>
          <li>When pasting content from Microsoft Excel, all office-related data is stripped. If the <a href="https://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/paste">paste</a> configuration is not set, this means the editor will default to "retain" styles instead of "prompt".</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Image selection sometimes worked incorrectly on Firefox with the spelling service enabled</li>
<li>Using the <span style="font-family: monospace">content.set()</span> API in the same function as creating an editor did not run input filters over the content</li>
<li>Editing HTML with a textarea in the content had unreliable cursor positioning, sometimes causing HTML tags to be incorrectly added inside the textarea</li>
<li>Calling <span style="font-family: monospace">editor.content.uploadImages()</span> no upload handler set removed the code view button</li>
<li>Image resize did not correctly preserve the aspect ratio on newer Firefox releases</li>
<li>Applying inline styles using the style menu added classes to the selection instead of replacing them</li>
<li>The <span style="font-family: monospace">content.selection.getText()</span> API sometimes included zero-width characters</li>
<li>Resizing the browser window did not update the toolbar position of docked toolbars for inline editing sections. The position is now recalculated on window resize and every time a section activates.</li>
<li>Applying a block style after triple clicking a paragraph in Chrome or Safari incorrectly applied the style to the following block</li>
<li>Style tags were included in the content when pasting from HTML sources such as Google Docs</li>
<li>Repeatedly pasting embeddable links in Firefox did not embed the links</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Textbox.io 2.3.0.36</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brand new word import process that supports more types of images, is more reliable and easier to maintain. Some of the fixes include:
        <ul>
          <li>Single blank lines between lists are no longer removed</li>
          <li>Unordered lists with wingding bullets are no longer imported as ordered lists</li>
          <li>Local images from documents with "rely on vml" set are now supported</li>
          <li>Unsupported list types are now imported as plain lists instead of paragraphs</li>
          <li>List font family and left margins are now included with "keep formatting"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>The Editor API now supports a <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/editor.events.change">change event listener</a>
</li>
<li>When multiple cells of a table are selected, backspace or delete now clears the contents of all selected cells</li>
<li>Editor popup and dialog elements are now attached to the page body element to operate better in modal dialog frameworks</li>
<li>Editor popups have switched from <span style="font-family: monospace">position: fixed</span> to <span style="font-family: monospace">position: absolute</span> and now maintain their position relative to the editor when scrolling the page</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<li>Deleting all content in Internet Explorer and then clicking below the cursor moved the cursor into an incorrect position</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Textbox.io 2.2.1.57</h2>
<h3>Please Note</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <span style="font-family: monospace">editor.content.getSelectedText</span> API has been deprecated. It has moved to <span style="font-family: monospace">editor.content.selection.getText</span> and will be removed in a future release.</li>
<li>The mobile editor UI currently renders on top of all other page elements and blocks touch events outside of the editor. Using a custom button to open a dialog can block user input on mobile.</li>

    <h2>Textbox.io 2.0.0.171</h2>
<h3>Please Note</h3>
<ul>
<li>Significant changes have been made to Textbox.io image management in this release. See our <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/Working+with+Images">Working with Images</a> article for more information.
